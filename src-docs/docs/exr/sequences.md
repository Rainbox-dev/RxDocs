# A note about frame sequences

Some people claim that using video files is easier than frame sequences. We thing it’s actually pretty easy to get used to it. If you need just one reason to switch to image sequences, keep this in mind: if the rendering process fails, or if you need to make changes to just a part of the video, you won’t have to re-render already rendered frames or frames where you didn’t make any change. They’re also easier to sync with services like Dropbox or your own NAS, as they’re smaller files easier sent through the network. These are just two examples of the advantages of image sequences.  
Of course, you’ll need to export the sound apart from the video, but this is done very quickly and can usually be automated with render presets.
